# Configuration

The `envoy-gateway` extension is enabled per shoot by adding an
`Extension` entry to `spec.extensions`. The extension is restricted to shoots
with `purpose: evaluation` during the GEP-68 incubation phase.

> The cluster-admin side of the deployment (registering the extension on the
> landscape so shoot owners can enable it) is documented separately in
> [deployment.md](deployment.md).


```yaml
apiVersion: core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1
kind: Shoot
spec:
  purpose: evaluation
  extensions:
    - type: envoy-gateway
      providerConfig:
        apiVersion: envoy-gateway.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
        kind: EnvoyGatewayConfig
        controlPlane:
          replicas: 2
          logLevel: info
        dataPlane:
          replicas: 2
          logLevel: info
        channel: standard
        manageCRDs: true
        manageDataPlaneNetworkPolicies: false

          accessLogging: true
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 256Mi
```

The `EnvoyGatewayConfig` has no `spec`/`status` wrapper — the configuration
fields live at the top level, following the convention of other Gardener
extension `providerConfig` APIs.

## Fields

### `controlPlane`

Envoy Gateway control-plane settings.

- `replicas` (int) — number of control-plane replicas. Default: `2`.
- `logLevel` (string) — control-plane log level. One of `debug`, `info`,
  `warn`, `error`. Default: `info`.

### `dataPlane`

Envoy data-plane (proxy) settings, applied per `Gateway`.

- `replicas` (int) — number of proxy replicas per `Gateway`. Default: `2`.
- `logLevel` (string) — data-plane log level. One of `debug`, `info`, `warn`,
  `error`. Default: `info`.

### `channel`

The Gateway API CRD channel to install. One of `standard` or `experimental`.
Default: `standard`.

Selecting `experimental` additionally installs the experimental-channel
Gateway API CRDs (`TCPRoute`, `TLSRoute`, `UDPRoute`, `BackendTLSPolicy`).
Experimental APIs may change in backwards-incompatible ways across Gateway
API releases. Operators that enable this option should track the upstream
release notes carefully.

### `manageCRDs`

When `true` (default), the extension installs and updates the Gateway API and
Envoy Gateway CRDs. Set to `false` if the CRDs are owned externally (for
example, managed by another controller or shipped via static manifests), in
which case the extension leaves them alone.

### `envoyProxyDefaults`

Opinionated defaults applied to every `Gateway` via an `EnvoyProxy` template
reference. Currently exposes:

- `accessLogging` (bool) — enables access-log emission on the data-plane
  Envoy proxies.
- `resources` (`corev1.ResourceRequirements`) — compute resources applied to
  every data-plane Envoy proxy container.

### `manageDataPlaneNetworkPolicies`

When `true`, the extension reconciles an ingress `NetworkPolicy` named
`envoy-gateway-proxies` into every shoot namespace that holds a `Gateway`. The
policy selects the data-plane proxy pods
(`app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: envoy-gateway`, `app.kubernetes.io/name: envoy`)
and allows ingress **from anywhere** on the data-plane ports (`10080`, `10443`,
`19003`), so traffic reaching the `Gateway`'s load balancer — external or
internal — can be delivered to the proxies on a cluster that enforces a
default-deny `NetworkPolicy` posture. Defaults to `false`.

Three ports are opened because they serve different callers on the ingress hop:

- `10080` / `10443` — the HTTP and HTTPS listeners that carry user traffic.
  Envoy Gateway shifts the Service's `:80`/`:443` down to these target ports
  because the proxies run non-root and cannot bind privileged ports.
- `19003` — the proxy's readiness endpoint (`/readyz`), probed by the kubelet
  and, in IP-target LB modes (e.g. GKE NEG, AWS NLB `target-type: ip`), by the
  load balancer directly. Opening it keeps the proxies visible as ready
  endpoints regardless of how the cloud provider wires the LB health check.

The extension writes these policies directly to the shoot and owns their full
lifecycle: a policy is created when a namespace gains its first `Gateway` and
removed once the namespace no longer holds one, or when the feature is disabled.
They cannot travel through the shoot `ManagedResource`, which reconciles only a
fixed set of namespaces and so cannot reach arbitrary `Gateway` namespaces.

Enable this only on shoots whose default-deny `NetworkPolicy` posture would
otherwise block `Gateway` traffic.

> **Scope — this covers only the *ingress* hop to the proxies.** A request to a
> `Gateway` traverses three hops, and on a default-deny namespace each must be
> allowed independently:
>
> | Hop | Allowed by |
> |-----|------------|
> | client → Envoy proxy (proxy ingress) | `manageDataPlaneNetworkPolicies` — **this feature** |
> | Envoy proxy → your backend (proxy egress) | **you** |
> | Envoy proxy → your backend (backend ingress) | **you** |
>
> The extension deliberately does not manage the proxy→backend hops: it cannot
> know which pods are your legitimate upstreams, and opening egress from the
> proxies to arbitrary workloads would be an overreach. If you enable this
> feature on a default-deny namespace and see `upstream connect error or
> disconnect/reset before headers` from Envoy, external traffic *is* reaching the

>   namespace: <gateway-namespace>

>     matchLabels:
>       app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: envoy-gateway
>       app.kubernetes.io/name: envoy
>   policyTypes: [Egress]
>   egress:
>     - {} # narrow to your backend + kube-dns in production
> ---
> # 2. Allow your backend pods to accept ingress from the proxies.

## What gets installed in the shoot

When the extension reconciles a shoot, it creates a `ManagedResource` in the
shoot's control-plane namespace on the seed. The contents of the
`ManagedResource` are applied into the shoot cluster:

1. ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, leader-election Role and
   RoleBinding for the Envoy Gateway controller (in `kube-system`).
2. The Envoy Gateway control-plane `Deployment` and `Service` (in
   `kube-system`).
3. A `PodDisruptionBudget` and `NetworkPolicy` objects for the control plane.
4. A single `GatewayClass` named `gardener-envoy-gateway` bound to the
   controller `gateway.envoyproxy.io/gatewayclass-controller`, plus a default
   `EnvoyProxy` template it references.
5. Standard-channel Gateway API CRDs (and the experimental channel when
   `channel: experimental`), unless `manageCRDs: false`.
6. Envoy Gateway's own CRDs (`EnvoyProxy`, `BackendTrafficPolicy`,
   `ClientTrafficPolicy`, `SecurityPolicy`, etc.) which power
   implementation-specific configuration, unless `manageCRDs: false`.

The data-plane ingress `NetworkPolicy` objects are **not** part of the
`ManagedResource`; when `manageDataPlaneNetworkPolicies` is enabled the extension
writes them directly into the `Gateway` namespaces (see
[`manageDataPlaneNetworkPolicies`](#managedataplanenetworkpolicies) above).

The Envoy Gateway control plane spawns one Envoy data-plane Deployment +
LoadBalancer Service per user-created `Gateway`, **in the `Gateway`'s own
namespace**. The cloud-provider load-balancer controller provisions the
underlying LB for each Service.

> [!NOTE]
> The data plane runs in the `Gateway`'s namespace because the extension pins
> Envoy Gateway to the `GatewayNamespace` deploy mode
> (`provider.kubernetes.deploy.type`). Earlier extension versions used the
> upstream default (`ControllerNamespace`), which placed every data-plane proxy
> and its LoadBalancer Service in `kube-system` using the control plane's
> privileged ServiceAccount — a confused-deputy escalation. See
> [Migration: data plane moved out of `kube-system`](#migration-data-plane-moved-out-of-kube-system)
> for what this means when upgrading an existing cluster.

## Migration: data plane moved out of `kube-system`

Extensions upgraded across the `GatewayNamespace` switch move each `Gateway`'s
data-plane proxy `Deployment` and its LoadBalancer `Service` from `kube-system`
into the `Gateway`'s own namespace. Envoy Gateway **recreates** the bundle in the
new namespace but does **not** garbage-collect the old copies it left in
`kube-system` — they were created directly by the controller (not via the
extension's `ManagedResource`), so nothing owns them anymore. Left alone this
would leave, per `Gateway`:

- an idle proxy `Deployment` (dead pods), and
- an orphaned `Service` of type `LoadBalancer` — which keeps a **cloud load
  balancer provisioned and billing** even though no traffic reaches it.

**The extension cleans this up automatically.** On every reconcile, right after
deploying the control plane, it sweeps `kube-system` for objects that carry
Envoy Gateway's `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=envoy-gateway` label **and** a
`gateway.envoyproxy.io/owning-gateway-name` label (i.e. per-`Gateway` data-plane
infra: `Service`, `Deployment`, `ServiceAccount`, `ConfigMap`, and any
`PodDisruptionBudget`/`HorizontalPodAutoscaler`) and deletes them. The
control-plane objects the extension installs in `kube-system` carry **no**
`owning-gateway-*` label, so the sweep never touches them. Deleting the orphaned
`LoadBalancer` Service triggers the cloud-controller-manager to deprovision its
LB, reclaiming the cost.

The sweep is idempotent and best-effort: once the orphans are gone it is a no-op,
it runs on the next reconcile after the new-namespace bundle exists, and a
transient failure is logged and retried on the following reconcile rather than
blocking reconciliation. No operator action is required — the cleanup happens the
next time each shoot reconciles under the new version. To confirm it has run, see
[Duplicate LoadBalancer / orphaned proxies in `kube-system` after upgrade](./troubleshooting.md#duplicate-loadbalancer--orphaned-proxies-in-kube-system-after-upgrade)
in the troubleshooting guide.

## Validation

The admission webhook validates the following on every Shoot create/update:

1. `spec.purpose` must be `evaluation` when the extension is enabled.
2. `providerConfig`, if supplied, must decode strictly as an
   `EnvoyGatewayConfig` (unknown fields are rejected).
3. `controlPlane.logLevel` and `dataPlane.logLevel`, if set, must be one of
   `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.
4. `channel`, if set, must be one of `standard`, `experimental`.
